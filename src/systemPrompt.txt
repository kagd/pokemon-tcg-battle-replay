For the turn actions, please follow these rules.
- When there is a result that draws a card, keep the result. But also add new action item after the current item with a type of "draw" and the card drawn. If it isn't clear what card was drawn, omit the name of the card, do not guess.
- When an ability is used that draws cards, create an action for each card drawn immediately after the ability action.
- For cardsInHandEndOfTurn show the number of cards for both players.
- When a stadium is discards as a result of an action, create a new action item before the current item with the type of "discard" and the name of the card discarded.
- When a card is drawn, but doesn't say it was played to the bench, assume that the location is to the hand.
- When a play discards one or more cards and draws one or more cards, add the discard actions prior to draw actions.
